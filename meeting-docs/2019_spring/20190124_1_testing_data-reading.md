## Recap of our first meeting this semester!
1. Here is a website where you can go and checkout the aurora activities in Dunedin, New Zealand
http://auroraalert.otago.ac.nz/aurora/index.html
2. Strings can be easily converted to integers by using the built-in `int()` function and floats by the `float()` function.
3. The `datetime` module can be used to give nice day-month-year formats when plotting time series data
4. Software testing is all-important and one should always be mindful of it. See this tutorial for more information:
