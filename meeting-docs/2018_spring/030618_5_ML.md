## Recap of our sixth meeting this semester! 
### Topic: Machine Learning
0. Coconut buns from [Happy Buns](http://goodfoodfinderaz.com/find-good-food/happy-buns-asian-bakery/), delicious coffee and chocolate!
1. Shanshan went through the final part of her presentation from [last time](https://github.com/prickly-pythons/prickly-pythons/blob/master/meeting-docs/2017_fall/121117_7_statistics.md) on using a random forest classifier to sort through some interesting gene data, with a dendrogram as a result.
2. Joe turned into a robot for a few minutes to illustrate the difficulties of programming a machine to do something (in this case making cupcakes).
He then introduced the concept of a Fourier transform and then talked about the problem of reconstructing an image when the phases of its Fourier transform were missing - the phase problem. Then Joe showed a [program](https://github.com/prickly-pythons/prickly-pythons/blob/master/code_from_meetings/research/phase_retrieval.ipynb) which can recover the image (in this case that of a cat) without knowing the boundary of the cat which would normally be required. This program was an example of a routine that could get a machine to adapt and learn, albeit still with hard-coded and carfeully chosen parameter values.
3. Neural networks was then introduced with reference to biological neurons. 
A single neuron was used as a classifier to differentiate between two types of irises as adapted from a [good notebook](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book/blob/master/code/ch02/ch02.ipynb) by S. Raschka on machine learning.
Lots of examples of machine learning was then given. All the references for those examples can be found [here](https://github.com/prickly-pythons/prickly-pythons/blob/master/code_from_meetings/machine_learning/Machine%20Learning.ipynb), Section 3.
4. The topic of artificial intelligence (AI) was then briefly discussed. 
Bill Wolf pointed out that there is an interesting, but potentially addictive, [game on making paperclips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Paperclips) (better to just read about it rather than play the actual game warns Bill), that illustrates the need to think carefully about the goals and objectives that we give to AI if we don't want to turn the universe into paperclips.
