## Recap of meeting 6 this semester!
1. Ax = lambda x

2. The action of a matrix is just a rotation and a scaling.

3. For matrices with real eigenvalues, a point flows outwards along eigenvectors with eigenvalues greater than one towards infinity, and flows inwards along eigenvectors with eigenvalues less than one towards the origin.

4. SVD and PCA are really just to do with eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The former involves eigen-decomposing the matrices A^TA and AA^T, and the latter is just keeping the biggest components of that decomposition.
