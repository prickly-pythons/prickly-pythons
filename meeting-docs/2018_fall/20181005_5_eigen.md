## Recap of meeting 6 this semester!
1. Ax = lambda x.
If this equation is satisfied then x is an eigenvector of the matrix A and lambda is an eigenvalue of the matrix A.

2. The action of a matrix can be described by a rotation and a scaling.

3. For matrices with real eigenvalues, a point flows outwards towards infinity along eigenvectors with eigenvalues greater than one, and flows inwards towards the origin along eigenvectors with eigenvalues less than one.

4. SVD and PCA are really just to do with eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The former involves eigen-decomposing the matrices A^TA and AA^T, and the latter is just keeping the biggest components of that decomposition.
