## Recap of meeting 4 this semester!
1. Brief introduction to the concept of Fourier transforms and the spectrum of signals
2. Some Fourier pairs:
Real space <--> Fourier space
<br>
time domain <--> Frequency domain
<br>
Sampling <--> Periodicity
<br>
Convolution <--> Multiplication 
<br>
3. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is efficiently done using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm in modern computers.
