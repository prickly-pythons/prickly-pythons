## Recap of meeting 6 this semester!
- Monaco is the second smallest country in the world. It has the Monte Carlo casino there which the method is named after.
- One of the simplest (pseudo) random number generators (RNGs) is the [linear congruential RNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator). They are usually not good enough for physics simulations and something like the [Mersenne Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) is better. 
- ```np.random.seed(x)``` will seed the random number generator in numpy with the value `x`. That way the result from your code will always be reproducible even when random numbers are involved, i.e. good practice for debugging and reproducibility.
- Errors in MC methods goes down as N^(-1/2), where N is the number of samples. This is worse than other integration methods such as the trapezoidal rule which scales as N^(-2).
