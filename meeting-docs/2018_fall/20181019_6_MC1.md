## Recap of meeting 6 this semester!
- Monaco is currently the second smallest country in the world. It has the Monte Carlo casino there which the method is named after.
- At the heart of Monte Carlo (MC) methods are random numbers. One of the simplest (pseudo) random number generators (RNGs) is the [linear congruential RNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator). They are usually not good enough for physics simulations and something like the [Mersenne Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) is better. 
- ```np.random.seed(x)``` will seed the random number generator in numpy with the value `x`. Remembering `x` will enable you to generate exactly the same set of random numbers again when you re-run the code. This way the result from your code will be reproducible even when random numbers are involved - good practice for debugging and reproducibility of results.
- Errors in MC methods goes down as 1/N^(1/2), where N is the number of samples. This is worse than other integration methods such as the trapezoidal rule which scales as 1/N^2. But MC is good for integrating complicated functions in higher dimensions as we will find next time.
