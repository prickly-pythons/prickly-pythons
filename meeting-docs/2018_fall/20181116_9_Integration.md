## Recap of meeting 9 this semester!
- Most physical integrals can, and needs to, be done numerically. 
- Trapezoidal and Simpson's rules are really just names for approximating the area under a curve with 1st order (linear) and 2nd order (quadratic) polynomials, respectively. Their formulae can be derived quite easily by considering each area segement underneath a curve.
- Higher order approximations can be done but the stability of the algorithm can become increasingly an issue.
- The `quad` function from Scipy is a good basic integration routine.
- Many other integration algorithms exist!
