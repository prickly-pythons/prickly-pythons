## Recap of meeting 2 this semester!
0. Frozen coconut buns.
1. ASCII and character encodings.
2. Converting between binary (base-2) and decimal (base-10) and hexadecimal (base-16)
2. Reading data - the hard way by writing custom c-style code (but definitely the route to learning how to program).
3. Quickly went through loading with numpy's genfromtext.
4. Finish early to accommodate gamma-ray burst seminar.
