## Recap of meeting 2 this semester!
0. Frozen coconut buns.
1. ASCII and character encodings.
2. Converting between binary (base-2), decimal (base-10) and hexadecimal (base-16) numbers
2. Reading data by writing custom code. Tedius and difficult but definitely the route to learning how to program.
3. Quickly went through loading with numpy's `genfromtext()` function. Will try and go through this again more carefully next time.
4. Finished early to accommodate gamma-ray burst seminar.
