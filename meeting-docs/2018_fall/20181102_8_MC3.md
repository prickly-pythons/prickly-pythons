## Recap of meeting 8 this semester!
- The Metropolis algorithm is a way to sample an otherwise difficult to sample function, due to the fact that the function may be in a high dimension space.
- The algorithm works by essentially doing a biased random walk over the function of interest, focusing on the important parts (regions where the value of the function is large).
- This is useful if the function happens to be a probability density function that we have to sum over to calculate the mean of some variable as the larger regions will contribute more to the mean.
- Wait until the random walk walker "equilibrates" before recording the values to be used for the mean.
- This was a very basic introduction. We will perhaps devote a few more sessions on the Metropolis algorithm and its uses in the future.
