# Welcome to the Prickly Pythons
This is a group for Python users, mainly at Arizona State Universsity in Tempe, Arizona. The group started as an idea for the School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) postdoctoral reserachers and graduate students to have a platform to discuss and share codes and ideas about Python and scientific programming in general. A major aim of the group is to help each other learn more and to develop a scientific programming community. Anyone with any level of programming exerience are welcome to join the group. Every member is encouraged to utilize this platform to help move the programming community forward!
